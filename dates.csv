500,"The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago."
800,"The Maoris, New Zealand’s first Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species."
1000,"None of us was alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more violent the world used to be."
1500,"The elephant birds and the giant lemurs, along with most of the other large animals of Madagascar, suddenly vanished about 1,500 years ago – precisely when the first humans set foot on the island."
3000,"These hierarchies are all the product of human imagination. Brahmins and Shudras were not really created by the gods from different body parts of a primeval being. Instead, the distinction between the two castes was created by laws and norms invented by humans in northern India about 3,000 years ago. Contrary to Aristotle, there is no known biological difference between slaves and free people."
3500,"A wall painting from an Egyptian grave, dated to about 3,500 years ago, depicting typical agricultural scenes."
4000,"A writing exercise from a school in ancient Mesopotamia discovered by modern archaeologists gives us a glimpse into the lives of these students, some 4,000 years ago: I went in and sat down, and my teacher read my tablet.He said, ‘There’s something missing!’ And he caned me."
4000,"The mammoths of Wrangel continued to prosper for a few more millennia, then suddenly disappeared about 4,000 years ago, just when the first humans reached the island."
5000,"If we look for the first words of wisdom reaching us from our ancestors, 5,000 years ago, we’re in for a big disappointment."
5000,"If you were an eighteen-year-old youth in a small village 5,000 years ago you’d probably think you were good-looking because there were only fifty other men in your village and most of them were either old, scarred and wrinkled, or still little kids."
9000,"Hunter-gatherers made these handprints about 9,000 years ago in the ‘Hands Cave’, in Argentina."
10000,"By 10,000 years ago there was not a single mammoth to be found in the world, except on a few remote Arctic islands, most conspicuously Wrangel."
10000,"If we could go back in time to 10,000 years ago and set the process going again, time after time, would we always see the rise of monotheism and the decline of dualism? We can’t do such an experiment, so we don’t really know."
10000,"In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other plant."
10000,"Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the earth."
10000,"Ten thousand years ago, not more than a few million sheep, cattle, goats, boars and chickens lived in restricted Afro-Asian niches. Today the world contains about a billion sheep, a billion pigs, more than a billion cattle, and more than 25 billion chickens."
10000,"The first crack in the old regime appeared about 10,000 years ago, during the Agricultural Revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-moving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of their offspring would be both fat and slow."
10000,"All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species."
10000,"This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat."
12000,"The Agricultural Revolution sped [history] up about 12,000 years ago."
12000,"The last dwarf-like humans vanished from Flores Island about 12,000 years ago."
14000,"American fauna 14,000 years ago was far richer than it is today. When the first Americans marched south from Alaska into the plains of Canada and the western United States, they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the size of bears, herds of horses and camels, oversized lions and dozens of large species the likes of which are completely unknown today, among them fearsome sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and reached a height of six metres."
15000,"Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago."
15000,"During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago."
16000,"Homo sapiens was the first and only human species to reach the western hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around 14,000 BC."
18000,"About 18,000 years ago, the last ice age gave way to a period of global warming."
20000,"Despite the lack of such biological instincts, during the foraging era, hundreds of strangers were able to cooperate thanks to their shared myths. However, this cooperation was loose and limited. An archaic sociologist living 20,000 years ago, who had no knowledge of events following the Agricultural Revolution, might well have concluded that mythology had a fairly limited scope."
30000,"The Sungir children are among the best pieces of evidence that 30,000 years ago Sapiens could invent sociopolitical codes that went far beyond the dictates of our DNA and the behaviour patterns of other human and animal species."
30000,"As far as we know, the people who carved the Stadel lion-man some 30,000 years ago had the same physical, emotional and intellectual abilities we have."
30000,"For example, there’s every reason to believe that a forager band that lived 30,000 years ago on the spot where Oxford University now stands would have spoken a different language from one living where Cambridge is now situated."
30000,"Physiologically, there has been no significant improvement in our tool-making capacity over the last 30,000 years. Albert Einstein was far less dexterous with his hands than was an ancient hunter-gatherer. However, our capacity to cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically."
30000,"Neanderthals made their exit roughly 30,000 years ago."
30000,"The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution."
30000,"Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves home around seven in the morning, makes her way through polluted streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same machine, in the same way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing hours, returning home around seven in the evening in order to wash dishes and do the laundry. Thirty thousand years ago, a Chinese forager might leave camp with her companions at, say, eight in the morning."
30000,"Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry? Historians seldom ask such questions."
45000,"The megafauna of New Zealand – which had weathered the alleged ‘climate change’ of c.45,000 years ago without a scratch – suffered devastating blows immediately after the first humans set foot on the islands."
45000,"Eucalyptus trees were rare in Australia 45,000 years ago. But the arrival of Homo sapiens inaugurated a golden age for the species. Since eucalyptuses are particularly resistant to fire, they spread far and wide while other trees and shrubs disappeared."
45000,"Fishing villages might have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years ago."
45000,"The climate changes that beset Australia about 45,000 years ago destabilised the ecosystem and made it particularly vulnerable."
45000,"Their first achievement was the colonisation of Australia some 45,000 years ago."
45000,"The most reasonable theory suggests that, about 45,000 years ago, the Sapiens living in the Indonesian archipelago (a group of islands separated from Asia and from each other by only narrow straits) developed the first seafaring societies."
45000,"Yet there is no evidence of any significant disappearance of oceanic fauna 45,000 years ago. Human involvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated the terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby oceans."
50000,"It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans were at that borderline point."
50000,"The last remains of Homo soloensis are dated to about 50,000 years ago."
70000,"About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures."
70000,"Homo sapiens reached the Middle East around 70,000 years ago."
70000,"If that is the case, the lineages of all contemporary humans can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000 years ago."
70000,"Not unusually severe for an ice age, it had twin peaks, the first about 70,000 years ago and the second at about 20,000 years ago."
70000,"Scientists also agree that about 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass."
70000,"The period from about 70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago witnessed the invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing)."
70000,"Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kickstarted history about 70,000 years ago."
100000,"About 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens groups migrated north to the Levant, which was Neanderthal territory, but failed to secure a firm footing."
100000,"Only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens – that man jumped to the top of the food chain."
150000,"Although Sapiens had already populated East Africa 150,000 years ago, they began to overrun the rest of planet Earth and drive the other human species to extinction only about 70,000 years ago."
150000,"Despite the benefits of fire, 150,000 years ago humans were still marginal creatures."
150000,"We don’t know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapiens first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapiens that looked just like us."
300000,"By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis."
400000,"It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis"
400000,"They slowly honed their hunting skills, and began going after large animals around 400,000 years ago."
800000,"Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago."
850000,"They had settled a few islands by swimming short stretches of water or crossing them on improvised rafts. Flores, for example, was colonised as far back as 850,000 years ago. Yet they were unable to venture into the open sea, and none reached America, Australia, or remote islands such as Madagascar, New Zealand and Hawaii."
1000000,"As best we can tell, from the earliest times, more than a million years ago, humans lived in small, intimate communities, most of whose members were kin."
1000000,"Thus humans who lived a million years ago, despite their big brains and sharp stone tools, dwelt in constant fear of predators, rarely hunted large game, and subsisted mainly by gathering plants, scooping up insects, stalking small animals, and eating the carrion left behind by other more powerful carnivores."
1500000,"The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages."
2000000,"About 2 million years ago, some of these archaic men and women left their homeland to journey through and settle vast areas of North Africa, Europe and Asia."
2000000,"On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers cuddling their babies and clutches of carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths chafing against the dictates of society and weary elders who just wanted to be left in peace; chest-thumping machos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old matriarchs who had already seen it all."
2000000,"The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species."
2000000,"Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in the appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus."
2500000,"Humans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from an earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus, which means ‘Southern Ape’."
2500000,"The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic centimetres."
2500000,"The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans."
6000000,"Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother."
25000000,"All cats, for example, from the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago."
65000000,"Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but in so doing opened the way forward for mammals."
600000000,"We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our wormlike ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?"
8000000000,"8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms."
